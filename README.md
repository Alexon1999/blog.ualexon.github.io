# blog-ualexon

Welcome to my tech-focused blog! This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, which I built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts and experiences on various tech topics, including data science, AI, software programming, tools and frameworks, and more.

## Getting started

This blog is built with a Minimal Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages [1].
