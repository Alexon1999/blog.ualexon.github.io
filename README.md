# blog-ualexon

Welcome to my tech-focused blog! This repository contains the source code for my personal blog, which I built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts and experiences on various tech topics, including data science, AI, software programming, tools and frameworks, and more.

## Getting started

This blog is built with a Minimal Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages [1].

#### Article Builder App

The Article Builder App is a software tool designed for writers who want to create beautiful and engaging articles. It is built using **PyQt6** and **Markdown** technologies, and it provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to write their articles in Markdown format.
